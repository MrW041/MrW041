# README
# 👋 Hey, I'm Waiz Mirza aka MrW041

🎓 I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student, currently diving deep into the world of **Cybersecurity**.  
💻 Passionate about tech, curious about everything, and always down to learn something new.

## 🚀 What I’m Up To
- Currently learning **Java** ☕ and messing around with **Linux & GitHub**
- Big fan of **Minecraft** — sometimes I take survival too seriously
- Experimenting with **IoT projects** using **NodeMCU**
- Slowly building my way into **Arduino & C++**

## 🧠 What I Know (So Far)
- 2 years of Python basics & some fun with its libraries
- HTML/CSS when needed (still not friends with CSS though)
- Learning how to structure projects and push them here on GitHub

## 🤝 Why I’m Here
I joined GitHub to:
- Learn how real-world devs do stuff
- Track my own coding journey
- Maybe even collaborate on small projects as a **Python dev**

## 🎮 Fun Stuff
- Minecraft is my comfort zone (ask me about my redstone disasters)
- I dual boot Ubuntu & Windows — pain? sometimes. worth it? yes.
